# A Double Commander unpacker (and packer) plugin for Yay0 archives.
The plugin was tested in Linux, but it builds a DLL with MinGW
It wouldn't have been possible without Jacknife's wcxhead.h, Yet Another GameCube Documentation, Ethan Roseman's Yay0 Encoder and Claude Code. So thanks :)
# Building
Use
```sh
make
```
